# ES & RI Integrated Business Management System (EIBMS)

A web-based business management system built for **ES & RI Enterprises**, a multi-branch construction materials company in Tanzania. Developed as a final-year diploma project at Warsaw University of Technology, 2026.

---

## What it does

EIBMS replaces manual paper records with a centralized digital system covering:

- **Multi-branch inventory management** — real-time stock tracking across Same and Ishinde branches with low-stock alerts
- **Production tracking** — records transformation of raw materials (cement, sand) into finished products (concrete blocks) with automatic stock deduction
- **Sales management** — records sales, handles cash/credit/partial payments, tracks customer balances
- **Expense management** — categorizes expenses for Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) tax reporting with CSV export
- **Fleet management** — tracks truck trips, fuel, maintenance costs and calculates per-truck profitability
- **Customer credit management** — monitors overdue balances and records repayments
- **Profit & Loss reports** — monthly financial performance using Pandas data analysis
- **REST API** — JWT-secured endpoints for future mobile app integration

## Business Context

ES & RI Enterprises operates two construction materials branches in Tanzania:
- **Same Branch** — sales, hardware, timber
- **Ishinde Branch** — concrete block production, pebbles

Before this system, all records were kept on paper. The owner had no visibility into where cash was going, could not prove expenses to TRA, and had no way to track which truck or branch was most profitable.
